In 2012 approximately 200 fast food workers in New York City walked off the job and rallied for higher wages. It was considered the largest series of demonstrations ever in the fast-food industry. Launching the Fight for $15, they called for being paid at least $15 an hour and to be given the right to unionize. Since then Fight for $15 has spread to over 270 cities across the nation.

Organizers behind fast food workers have set their sights on a bigger national strategy. They hope to unite low-wage workers under the banner of civil rights by connecting the Fight for $15 campaign with connecting the Black Lives Matter movement. </P>
<p class="text">
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has been the same since 2009. Efforts have stalled in Congress to increase wages. The near stagnation of hourly wages for low-income workers has become part of the political discourse. Presidential candidate and Sen. Bernie Sanders and other Democratic members of Congress introduced a bill to raise the minimum to $15 an hour. Other Democratic presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton have called for a raise to $12. 
</p>
<p class="text">
This is surprising given that in 2013, Democrats were debating whether the minimum should be $9 or $10.10 an hour. In 2012, the highest state minimum wage was just over $9. Since Jan. 2014, however, the minimum wage has increased in 26 states and Washington D.C., according to the Consumer Price Index as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many cities have also passed or proposed legislation to create a local minimum wage that is higher than the federal minimum and their own state's minimum. Today there are several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and New York with $15 minimums.

At the state and local level, there has been an unprecedented wave of movement to boost hourly wages for low-income workers. On Nov. 10, one year before the presidential election, Black Lives Matter joined the Fight for $15 campaign and planned walkouts in 270 cities, including San Diego, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Jose. The strike called for California to pass a November 2016 ballot initiative that would raise the statewide minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2020 and guarantee six paid sick days to all California workers. According to a field poll done in 2015, 68% voters in California back a minimum wage increase to $15. </p>
